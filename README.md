Hello and welcome to my single page application!

The application gives you a random selection of 10 Bob Ross paintings
that you can sort through and decide if you would like to keep a painting
in your "Personal Gallery" or send a painting to the "Auction House".

On page load you will be asked to enter your name.

Next, you will automatically be provided with an assortment of Bob Ross paintings.

The paintings are interactive thumbnails that will show a larger view of the painting
when clicked on. 

Each painting has two corresponding buttons labled "I'll Take It" and "I'll Pass".
The "I'll Take It" button will add the painting to your Personal Gallery while the
"I'll Pass" button will add the painting to your Auction House collection.

When you finish sorting your initial 10 paintings a button labeled "Load More Paintings to Sort"
will become visible, when you click this button, 10 more random Bob Ross paintings will be loaded.

You can sort to your hearts content, as you have over 400 priceless paintings to choose from!

Thank you for visiting my single page application, 

Matt
